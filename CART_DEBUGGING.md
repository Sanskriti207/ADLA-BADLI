# ðŸ›’ Cart Not Showing - Debugging Guide

## Quick Test Steps:

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open your browser console (Press F12) and:
- Click the cart icon in the top right navigation
- Look for these console messages:
  - `"Cart button clicked, showCart: [true/false]"`
  - `"ShoppingCart component - isOpen: [true/false], cartItems: [...]"`

### 2. Verify Cart Icon is Visible
- Look for the shopping cart icon ðŸ›’ in the top-right navigation bar
- It should be next to the search box and before the user profile
- Try clicking it directly

### 3. Test with Items in Cart
The cart might need items to display properly:
1. Scroll down to the Marketplace section
2. Click "View Details" on any product
3. Click "Add to Cart"
4. OR click "Add to Cart" directly from the marketplace grid
5. Then click the cart icon in the navigation

### 4. Check for Errors
Look in the browser console for any red error messages related to:
- CartContext
- useCart
- ShoppingCart component

## What I've Fixed:

1. âœ… Added console logging to cart button click
2. âœ… Added console logging to ShoppingCart component
3. âœ… Increased modal z-index from 50 to 60
4. âœ… Verified CartProvider is in AppProviders

## If Still Not Working:

Try these steps:
1. **Hard Refresh**: Press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and reload
3. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages in browser console

## Expected Behavior:

When you click the cart icon:
1. A backdrop should appear (dark overlay)
2. A white/glass panel should slide in from the right
3. The panel should show:
   - "Shopping Cart" header
   - List of items (or "Your cart is empty")
   - Checkout button (if items present)

## Test Without Items:

Even with an empty cart, you should see:
- Dark backdrop overlay
- Empty cart message: "Your cart is empty"
- Cart icon ðŸ›’ in the center

If you don't see ANY of these, check console for errors!
