## üìä Technical Details

### Wallet Fix Details:

**Before**:
```typescript
// Was trying to use makeTransaction (doesn't exist)
await makeTransaction(user.id, 'received', parseFloat(amount), 'Added Funds');
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Now uses proper context methods
const result = await addFunds(parseFloat(amount));
await refreshWallet();
await refreshTransactions();
```

### Profile Message Button:

**Implementation**:
```typescript
<button 
  onClick={() => {
    const chatBtn = document.querySelector('[class*="bottom-24"]') as HTMLElement;
    if (chatBtn) chatBtn.click();
  }}
  className="..."
>
  <MessageCircle className="w-4 h-4" />
  Messages
</button>
```

This finds the floating chat button and clicks it programmatically.
